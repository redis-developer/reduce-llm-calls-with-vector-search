    "# Semantic Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic classification is a machine learning technique that categorizes text based on its meaning using vector embeddings and similarity matching. This approach offers a compelling alternative to using large language models (LLMs) for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semantic Classification vs. LLM Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM-based classification** involves sending text to models like GPT-4 or Claude with prompts asking them to categorize content. While powerful, this approach has several limitations:\n",
    "- **Cost**: API calls for every classification can be expensive at scale\n",
    "- **Latency**: Network requests and model inference add delay\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic classification** uses vector embeddings to represent text meaning numerically, then applies similarity thresholds to determine categories:\n",
    "- **Speed**: Near-instantaneous vector similarity calculations\n",
    "- **Cost-effective**: No API costs after initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is converted into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. Reference examples for each category are embedded, and new content is classified by measuring vector similarity. Content that falls within a defined distance threshold of category references gets classified accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a semantic classifier using RedisVL to identify AI-related content, demonstrating an efficient alternative to LLM-based classification."
